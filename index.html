				<div class="answer">
					<p><span class='highlight'>Object-oriented programming</span> (OOP) is a software programming model constructed around objects. This model compartmentalizes data 		into objects (data fields) and describes object contents and behavior through the declaration of classes (methods).	
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>OOP features include the following:	
						a)	<span class='highlight'>Encapsulation</span>: This makes the program structure easier to manage because each object’s implementation and state are hidden behind well-defined boundaries.
						b)	<span class='highlight'>Polymorphism</span>: This means abstract entities are implemented in multiple ways.
						c)	<span class='highlight'>Inheritance</span>: This refers to the hierarchical arrangement of implementation fragments.
						Object-oriented programming allows for simplified programming. Its benefits include reusability, refactoring, extensibility, maintenance and efficiency.

				<p class='question-btn'>What are the four basic OOP and examples <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></p>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>There are 4 major concepts that make an Object Oriented. These are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance. 	These are also called as 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
					</p>
					<img src="img/1.png">
					<p><span class='highlight'>Encapsulation</span> is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this. Look at the example below:</p>	
					<img src="img/2.png">
					<p>The public setXXX() and getXXX() methods are the access points of the instance variables of the EncapTest class. Normally, these methods are referred as getters and setters. Therefore, any class that wants to access the variables should access them through these getters and setters. Output below:</p>
					<img src="img/3.png">
					<p><span class='highlight'>Abstraction</span> is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. This section provides you an example of the abstract class. To create an abstract class, just use the abstract keyboard before the class keyword, in the class declaration. Declaration and Output below:</p>
					<img src="img/4.png">
					<img src="img/5.png">
					<p><span class='highlight'>Polymorphism</span> is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms. So, polymorphism means many forms. It is also the ability of an object to take many forms. To simply put, polymorphism in java allows us to perform the same action in many different ways. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic and in java, all the java objects are polymorphic as it has passed the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object. Let’s say we have a class Animal that has a method sound(). Since this is a generic class so we can’t give it an implementation like: Roar, Meow, Oink etc. We had to give a generic message.</p>	
					<img src="img/6.png">
					<p>Now let’s say we have two subclasses of Animal class: Horse and Cat that extend Animal Class. We can provide the implementation to the same like this: </p>
					<img src="img/7.png">
					<p>and</p>
					<img src="img/8.png">
					<p>As you can see that although we had the common action for all subclasses sound() but there were different ways to do the same action. This is a perfect example of polymorphism (features that allows us to perform a single action in different ways).</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Types of Polymorphism</strong></p>
					<br>
					<p>Polymorphism in Java can be performed by two different methods</p>
					<img src="img/9.png">

					<p><span class='highlight'>1. Static Polymorphism</span> also known as compile time polymorphism – Method Overloading in java is an example of compile time (or static polymorphism). </p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Method Overloading</strong> - is defined as a process that can create multiple methods of the same name in the same class, and all the methods work in different ways. Method overloading occurs when there is more than one method of the same name in the class. Example below:</p>
					<br>
					<p>Overload.java</p>
					<img src="img/10.png">
					<p>MethodOverloading.java</p>
					<img src="img/11.png">
					<p>Here the method demo() is overloaded 3 times: first method has int parameter, second method has 2 int parameter and third one is having double parameter which method is to be called is determined by the arguments we pass while calling methods. This happens at compile time so this type of polymorphism is known as compile polymorphism. Output below:</p>
					<img src="img/12.png">

					<p><span class='highlight'>2.	Dynamic Polymorphism </span>also known as runtime polymorphism - is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, that’s why it is called runtime polymorphism. Method Overriding in Java is example of runtime time (or dynamic polymorphism)</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Method Overriding</strong> - is defined as a process when the subclass or a child class has the same method as declared in the parent class. Example below:</p>
					<br>
					<p>Animal.java</p>
					<img src="img/13.png">
					<p>Horse.java</p>
					<img src="img/14.png">
					<br>
					<p>Output:</p>
					<img src="img/15.png">

					<p>Cat.java</p>
					<img src="img/16.png">
					<br>
					<p>Output:</p>
					<img src="img/17.png">

					<p><span class='highlight'>Inheritance</span> is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. In this example, you can observe two classes namely Calculation and My_Calculation. Using extends keyboard, the My_Calculation inherits the methods addition() and Subtraction() of Calculation class.</p>

					<h1>-Bernardo</h1>
					<p>When she was still alive, she would tell us, “habang andito pa ako, kunin niyo na lahat ng pwede niyong matutunan sa’kin, kasi sa field mahirap.  Kanya kanyang diskarte roon.”  As a second-year college student, this career path is something I never dreamt of, and a course that I never thought I can get through with, adding the fact that for the past years, we have always been under pressure and it’s never been easy since pandemic begun.  We are Prof. Fajardo’s students and it was a different story – a different impact on every student, and mine is here.
The first time HTML and CSS was introduced to us by Prof. Fajardo, it made me sigh because I know for sure, it will be another tough year of relying on my classmates.  Programming was and will never be a subject I like and will like.  It seems complicated to me that I am not even bothered to be curious despite the fact that I am an IT Student.  However, Prof. Fajardo, a tough and strict professor is someone who molds each student with her terror and enthusiast to teach.  For the very first time, I became interested, not because I really wanted to, but because she made me to – for the sake of grades of course, and eventually, learning the HTML and CSS became fun.  
It was during the first semester; we were given a task. Three web pages, the same design with what our prof sent us, to be submitted within five days.  Take note, the codes should be written with indention in a yellow paper or bond paper or clean notebook.  How could we possibly accomplish that task?  We were away from each other; we are only virtually connected from our classmates and all we can rely upon are the lectures our professor sent us and the Google.  Where could we possibly get a copy with the exact instructions?  That week was hell.  But today, looking back to 9 months ago, I was grateful, for every time that we were scolded because she would catch some of us cheat and sometimes, she would just let us learn on our own, not even allowed an activity by pair or by group – all of them individually done.  With her eagle-like eyes and can sense the smell of cheating, we indeed are doomed.  In the end, I was able to learn HTML, CSS and the basic of Java.  The class even got help from Prof. Fajardo, she willingly taught us the basics of java – those are the times when the person who supposedly teach us left without notice and the class are left behind.  We were so grateful for giving us her time.  I should’ve listened and focused more during those classes we had, if I only knew what will happen – I would’ve not played confident that I can always learn from her until I graduate, but savor all the knowledge she willingly shared instead.  
Since first semester that Prof. Fajardo mentioned the capstone, I was looking forward that she would be our professor, otherwise, she will be on panelist – which every student in ITECH wouldn’t want.  “Mabuti nang maging prof na lang natin sya sa capstone para pulido gawa natin, kesa magisa nya sa defense,” the students would say.  But now, she’s gone.  Maybe she’s gone, but her knowledge and expertise will live as long as her students will.  And for a student like me with a hopeless beginning, having Prof. Fajardo with my introduction to Web Development and Object-Oriented Programming, the latter might be feasible.

					<h1>-Dongon</h1>
					<p>Hello my name is Emmanuel Dongon, currently taking DICT in PUP ITECH. I'm a correspondence student, I lack devices and stable internet connection to attend online classes.I respect Ms. Fajardo for understanding the situation of the correspondence students, making us just do the activities offline. having more time to finish the activity and assignment and pass it at the due date given to us since we are lack of any devices to code, debug and compile. I understand and learned the language of Java, C and C++. I learn the GUI Component and console application, learned the difference between identifiers and variables. I enjoy learning more new stuff in coding but the only problem is just lack devices. I have trouble understanding HTML and CSS cause I'm not familiar with it and can't understand much. even thought I lack devices I read information just how to run a code and try borrow a pc to a relative to make it run and debug if it has any bugs. I may not know everything and sometimes forgot the teachings but I think I can still run any program.</p>

					<h1>-Canindo</h1>
					<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a PC programming model that coordinates programming plan around information, or articles, as opposed to capacities and rationale. OOP centers around the items that designers need to control as opposed to the rationale needed to control them. OOP makes the coding and bug detecting easier. It is very vital knowledge every programmer must be aware of, aside from it makes coding easier, it is helpful in terms of designing a frame using GUI (Graphical User Interface).</p>

					<h1>-Garzon</h1>
					<p>In my own understanding about Object-oriented programming (OOP), it is like a real scenario of how we actually see or deal with certain things in our lives. For example, in dealing with big obstacles or challenges, we tend to break down large problems into subproblems and solve them separately, one problem at a time but in Object-oriented programming; it is one object at a time. Thus, I've realized how important it is to know and put practice of object-oriented programming when making programs because it provides a clear structure of programs, faster and easier execution, possible to create a reusable application, and lastly makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug. These are possible because object-oriented programming has 4 features, namely: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance. In encapsulation, it can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class also known as "data hiding", while abstraction is responsible for hiding the complexity of programs by hiding unnecessary details of the actual implementation. Polymorphism can be defined as "having multiple forms in a single entity", and lastly, inheritance is the ability to extend the functionality from the base entity in the new entity belonging to the same group.</p>

					<h1>-Ningal</h1>
					<p>Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a type of programming that uses objects to show the clear structure of a project. It is like creating a program then following how this program works with design with the perception of programmer how this program should work. Classes And Objects are the main elements of OOP and with the use of Java language which cannot run without those elements of OOP, it is the most common language used in OOP. Ma’am Ethel Fajardo taught us the basic use of GUI (Graphical User Interface) and it is like coding with some visual experience of simple interface of software. By using JOptionPane, we saw simple dialog box that shows where you can input data and it can also display results after the user inputs some data on it. Applying those concepts shows that OOP is basically helps the programmer build some visual experience of computer language with presentation of input data in a straightforward manner. OOP lets the programmer to create methods and variables then to compile it to present the overall appearance of codes. We can use this programming model to create a program with functions and procedures to visualized and experience the program in a graphical presentation of inputs.</p>

					<h1>-Blanco</h1>
					<p>The best thing Ma'am Fajardo taught me and probably she had no idea about, she pushed me to appreciate my course. Believe it or not, I remember when I was still a freshman,  I don't feel anything but hatred to this course and especially to myself because of my decision of pursuing this even though I knew in my heart, it wasn't really the thing I want. I just stayed because I don't want to waste the amount of time I had spent and I don't want to disappoint my family. Impostor syndrome consumed me that I always felt like I was the dumbest person in our room whenever I couldn't able to figure out on how to run a certain code for our activity. I always envied others who genuinely love and enjoyed the path they were taking. On the other hand, I always pitied myself for not feeling the same way like they do. But things somehow changed now and better than before specifically my mindset. I'm not saying that she was all the reason, but definitely, she became a big factor. Because of her teaching ethic, like being strict to us most of the time, it challenged me. That's why when I heard the bad news from our homeroom president, I was so shocked. It was difficult for me to digest the thought that the most decent teacher we ever had during this pandemic was suddenly gone. And that was only the time I realized the impact she inflicted in me.</p>

					<h1>-Laxamana</h1>
					<p>In my one understanding, OOP can help you consider objects in a program's code and the different actions that could happen in relation to the objects. This programming style widely exists in commonly used programming languages like Java, C++ and PHP. These languages help simplify the structure and organization of software programs like GUI. Ms. Fajardo also teaches how to make subclass that makes the program codes more easier to understand because its separated by subclass so its much more easier to find the error or bug. OOP also teaches us how to design a program in java by using GUI amd its easy to learn because the text, button, or checkbox is drag drop so its convenient and faster to do. OOP programming is a natural approach that you to solve complex problems quickly and easily.</p>

					<h1>-Alcoriza</h1>
					<p>When I was in my first year of college in iTech, I’ve been hearing all those hearsays that there’s this one terror teacher that who always drops a bomb in her 2nd and 3rd year classes. And of course, as a freshman, I’ve been terrified because I don’t know what I am going to do. Then one time, I’m with my professor and having a conversation with her, and then suddenly, she smells something, “Nandyan na si Maam Fajardo.” My professor recognized her because she knows what perfume Maam Fajardo is using. She is that iconic in iTech that once they smell that perfume, the people will know she’s nearby. And she’s one heck of a teacher. I experienced how she teach us, and I confirmed that she is a really strict teacher. I will always be this nervous student every time I come to her class. But of course, her “strict-teaching” kind of way has a reason. And it works even not for all of us but in some. Even though we haven’t met face to face, but I’m surely had a lot of knowledge I gained from her since I entered iTech. And I think her perfume symbolizes that maybe she isn’t with us right now, she’s still there somewhere looking at us and being proud for what her students have done.</p>

					<h1>-Gelladula</h1>
					<p>I am really fond of designing websites since I am in Junior High School so I was so excited when I learned that we will study it under Ma’am Fajardo. I know that she is knowledgeable on this lesson and I will learn most of the information I needed. During the OOP subject, I had a hard time. I don’t have any background on Java because I took up ABM on my Senior High School days instead of ICT. It is fun to learn something new though, like creating GUIs in Eclipse, understanding classes and many more. I know, I still have a lot to learn on Java but what I’ve learned this semester built a foundation on understanding more about it.</p>

					<p>On my own understanding of the subject and to put it simple, it is a style of programming where we use classes or rather we called object as a container of different methods or unset variables on purpose to achieve the maintainability and reusability of code.</p>

					<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
					<p>Write a program that replies either Leap Year or Not a Leap Year, given a year. It is a leap year if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 (for example, 1796 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 but not by 100). A year that is divisible by both 4 and 100 is a leap year if it is also divisible by 400 (for example, 2000 is a leap year, but 1800 is not).</p>

					<p>The hourly wage of an employee is $7.25, so they will enter the hours of they work to get the "hours" variable. For the overtime payment, the given said that "time-and-a-half of their basic rate" so basically it is $7.25 * 50% is equals to $10.875, so input the overtime hours that that you did and you will get the  "ot". The last one is sales, we used if else statement because for the first commission fee is if you did $1 to $99.99 of the sales you will get 5% for the commission, $100 of sales to $299.99 of sales will give you 10% for the commission, and more than $300 of sales will give you 15% for the commission. The last is just an output of everything that you earn</p>

					<h3>Activity 1.A</h3>
						<p>CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISE: Imagine that you and your band have just recorded a
						song, and you want to permit fans to purchase and download the song over the Internet.
						Your manager receives a commission equal to 12% of the total sales revenue for your
						song. and the Internet site that list your song receives a 3% commission. Using a
						CLASS DIAGRAM, design your SUB CLASS.
						THEN design a Java Program that ask for the title of the song, the purchase price of
						the song (in peso and cents), and the number of copies of the song that have been
						sold. Calculate the total revenue generated by your song, the commission received by
						your manager, and the commission received by the Internet site.
						Write your design to the following space. Your design should be 1 Class Diagram and
						a list of Java Comments without any codes
